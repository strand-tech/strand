Description: Provides a framework for performing discrete (share-level) simulations of
  investment strategies. Simulated portfolios optimize exposure to an input signal subject
  to constraints such as position size and factor exposure. For background see L. Chincarini
  and D. Kim (2010, ISBN:978-0-07-145939-6) "Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management".
